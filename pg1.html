                <p>Winston was directly descended from an epic 17th century face-wrecker named John Churchill.  John will eventually have a page on this site as well, but since I haven't gotten around to writing it yet here's a brief rundown of that dude's life:  He was born into <strong>extreme poverty</strong>, joined the army as a lowly page, worked his way up through the ranks to command the entire British military, was knighted, became a Duke, served under five different Kings, beat the snot out of Louis XIV's allegedly-invincible army, and is now remembered (along with Wellington) as Britain's greatest and most brilliant military commander.  So that guy was a tough act to follow. Winston didn't disappoint.</p>

              <p>After a brief stint fighting on the front lines as a battalion commander in the Grenadier Guards – one of the most prestigious and elite military units in the British Army – for the entirety of World War I (no big deal, right?), Churchill was elected to the British Parliament.  Thanks for his oratory skill and his generally <strong>unassailable badassery</strong>, Churchill worked his way up through the ranks, constantly pushing for the construction of tanks, aircraft, and warships (Spoiler Alert: This foresight would actually work out pretty well for Winston down the line).</p>

              <p>Churchill took every possible opportunity to tell Communism and Nazism to <strong>"suck it"</strong> because Churchill  loved Democracy and Capitalism and that's just how he rolled.</p>

              <p> <strong>Winston Churchill</strong> - known to the Russians as "The British Bulldog" for his unyielding tenaciousness and his awesome ability to train killer attack hounds to run up and bite Fascists in the jugular when they weren't looking - was one of the most badass world leaders of the modern era.Â </p>

              <p> This dude was a totally righteous <strong>asskicker</strong> who enjoyed puffing on Cuban cigars, shooting guns, drinking copious amounts of booze, and kicking Nazis in the fucking balls with a Size 10 steel-toed boot, and he didn't give a crap about anything that didn't further his goal of accomplishing one of those four tasks.</p>

              <p>He <strong>fought hard</strong>, partied hard, wore a lot of totally awesome suits, and pretty much always looked like he'd just stepped out of a badass 1930s pulp fiction detective story.</p>
